Model Module
============

This module provides a PyTorch Lightning Module for a simple neural network model. It includes methods for training, validation, and testing steps, as well as configuration for optimizers and learning rate schedulers. The model uses configurable parameters such as hidden dimensions, dropout rate, learning rate, and patience for reducing the learning rate.
